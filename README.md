# Movielens 20M Recommendation Systems

This repo contains recommendation systems trained on Movielens 20M Recommendation Systems. It contains following models:
1. User-User and Item-Item Collaborative Filtering Models
2. NeuralMF- Matrix Factorization with MLP layers
3. AutoRec- AutoEncoder based recommendation system
4. MF-BPR- Bayesian Popularity based Matrix Factorization model where we use triplet loss to create a retreiver

<b>Note:</b> I  used tensorflow and sklearn for them, and I will also add more to this project by adding pytorch application with a proper recommendation system stack. We could also use huggingface based sentiment analysis models and finetune the model leading to a simple but efficient recommendation system.
